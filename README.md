<h2>Day 10</h2>

Actions taken:

- Advanced on Applied DS, DS IBM
- Completed 1/10 of IBM DS (Orientation to Data Science)


Thoughts: I was stocked to get thru the Orientation to Data Dcience IBM first module. 3 weeks of content done in 3 days.
Obviously the content was quite familiar to me as I have studied the subject before. 
But looking into learning more and things will eventually get harder.
